# StaTech Industry 1.1.7 Changelog:
General bugfix update. Please note this update also includes the fixes for the MI Nuclear Reactor crashes that were addressed in its latest update. Rejoice!

## New multiblocks
### The Blood Generator
Finally a use for all that excess blood from the Mob Crusher multiblock! Unlocked at the HV-tier, it (hopefully) is a powerful alternate power generation method. This large multiblock generator is made possible by the continued continued support of the MI devs!
